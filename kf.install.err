DEPRECATION: pytorch-lightning 1.6.4 has a non-standard dependency specifier torch>=1.8.*. pip 24.0 will enforce this behaviour change. A possible replacement is to upgrade to a newer version of pytorch-lightning or contact the author to suggest that they release a version with a conforming dependency specifiers.
